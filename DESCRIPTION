Description: Functions for defining systems of Mendelian inheritance (defined broadly)
    and making predictions about the distribution of offspring genotypes and phenotypes
    in crosses. The package can handle arbitrary numbers of linkage groups, loci and alleles
    per locus, as well as arbitrarily defined phenotypes for one or more traits. This means that
    traits can be polygeneic and involve epistasis. 
    Gene expression that is parent-of-origin specific (imprinting) or controled by other genes in cis
    is also supported. 
    The current version only supports autosomal linkage groups.
