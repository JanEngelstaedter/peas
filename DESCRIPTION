Description: Functions for defining systems of Mendelian inheritance (defined broadly) and making predictions about the distribution of offspring genotypes and phenotype in genetic crosses. 
  The package can handle multiple linkage groups with autosomal, sex-  chromosomal or uniparental inheritance, with arbitrary numbers of loci and alleles per locus. 
  Multiple traits can be freely defined, potentially involving pleiotropy, polygeny and epistasis. The systems can also include parent-of-origin effects (e.g., genomic imprinting) and cis-regulatory effects.
